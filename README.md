# What is WeTube?
WeTube is a YouTube player by me, Zane. It uses the same method as google classroom, edpuzzle, etc. to enable for an anti-ad, tracking free experience. This allows for the video to be unblocked at school and other work places ig.
Since this is a file, it cannot be blocked due to it not having a URL (I still wouldn't test that theory so keep it lowkey). Just download the file, open it, and watch some videos!
Enjoy ;]


# Extra info:
The reason this site can play videos like this is because it utilizes the YouTube api to get videos directly from YouTube, and then directly converts the video into YouTube's privay enhanced embed mode to make sure there are no tracking cookies until you actually click the watch button. And even then, there are very few. It's these cookies and the fact that they are linked to your school account/computer that is the main cause of the blocking of YouTube. This is just an automated way of putting the video id at the end of a youtube-nocookie link, with a nice UI and premade API keys1 to go along with it.

Otherwise, download the file and open it. It will still work mostly.
