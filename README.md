WeTube is a YouTube player by me, Zane. It uses the same method as google classroom, edpuzzle, etc. to enable for an anti-ad, tracking free experience. This allows for the video to be unblocked at school and other work places ig.
Since this is a file, it cannot be blocked due to it not having a URL (I still wouldn't test that theory so keep it lowkey). Just download the file, open it, and watch some videos!
Enjoy ;]
